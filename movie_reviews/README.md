## Using sentiment analysis to predict good or bad movie reviews
### Current model : Ridge Regression Classifier

The first iteration of this project was a lot of trial and error, as was warned in class. I focused on the parameters within the hashing vectorizer to find progress in fits of various models. Within these parameters, the most positive changes came from increasing the amount of features with 'n_features' and using the strip_accents="unicode" which performs character normalization during preprocessing. Within the models, I experimented with different alpha values and normalization (RDG only). The alpha values help with finding the right learning rate with the goal of finding a minimum more effectively. Normalization changes column values to a common scale without affecting differences in the value ranges. These last two concepts are still new to me, but I am learning by experimenting with them! I chose the ridge regression classifier because I ended up with the lowest number of FPs and FNs after adjustuing the original starter code from being too overfitted and experimenting with the parameters I mentioned. Also, regarding the other models that were close to RDG in the test set graph, I chose RDG over LGS and SVM because it made sense to me to have less false positives even if the true positive count is lower than the other two as of now.
